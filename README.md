# Data_Structures_Backtracking2
This project solves the coloring problem. The objective of this project is to create a graph and assign a color to each of the verticies. The rules are that no adjacent verticies should have the same color.
This project utilizes backtracking to find the quickest solution. 
This project also has many practical applications as well, including:
1. Creating a biparte graph
2. Exam scheduling: create exam schedules for students so that no two exams overlap
3. Radio tower frequency: frequencies assigned to the same tower must be different due to interference
4. Map coloring: no adjacent country on a map should be the same color
